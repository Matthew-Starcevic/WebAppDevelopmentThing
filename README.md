It's for the class, what else is there to say?

So, you're probably wondering why I've brought you here today. Well, I haven't. You came here. Why? Beats me. Perhaps you're the adventurous sort. Perhaps you're curious about who I am. Perhaps you got here by accident. Whatever the case may be, you're here now. So welcome. Welcome to my little corner on this massive network of programming and such. Here you will find... Well, mostly nonsense. Nonsense, and things related to the assignments for this Drake University course. If you happen to have no idea what I mean by 'Drake University course', I would first suggest consulting a dictionary. If you still don't know what it means, then you probably don't need to know, as you're probably not involved. To the rest of you, I once again say welcome. Enjoy your stay. Or don't. I'm a README, not the police. Well, actually, I'm a person, writing a README. But you get the point. I don't rule your life. I barely rule my own. I'm just trying to survive out here, preferably without going crazy. But hey, only time will tell how that will end. For now, I wish you a good day. Or night. Or evening. Or afternoon. Or morning. Or whatever else you might prefer. If you need me, I'll be staring into the abyss, and watching it stare back.
